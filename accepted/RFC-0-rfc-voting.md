# Voting Protocol

## 1. General Rules

1. Only Class 1 and Class 2 members of Open Source Matters may initiate a call for
   votes on a measure.
2. Votes can be +1 (“in favor”), -1 (“against”), or 0 (“abstain”).
3. The quorum is met when the number of votes is greater than or equal to the specified
   fraction of the number of voting members. 
   Example: Let the quorum be one-third.
      - If there are 20, 21, or 22 members, then 7 or more must vote within the
        time limit for the vote to be valid.
      - If there are 23, 24, or 25 members, then 8 or more must vote within the
        time limit for the vote to be valid.
4. The measure passes if a simple majority of the votes cast are “in favor”, i.e.,
   tne number of "in favor" votes is greater than the number of "against" votes. The
   measure does not pass otherwise.
5. The RFC votes are not secret. Names and votes will be published in the Meta
   document of the RFC, independent from the outcome of the vote.

_N.B.: “Abstain” votes are counted only for quorum, and are not counted when calculating majority._
