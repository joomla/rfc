# Joomla! Feature / Specification RFCs

The idea behind this repository is to provide a central place for RFCs for new
features for the Joomla! projects and Specifications (interfaces) for further 
development.

The index of existing RFCs, whether they are in Pre-Draft state or accepted, is found in [index.md](index.md). 

## Proposing a Joomla! Feature or a Joomla! Specification

To propose a Feature / Specification:

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the Feature / 
  Specification RFC in `proposed/`, push the branch to Github, and send a pull 
  request; or,
- create a ticket to start a discussion on Github; or,
- start a conversation on the [CMS mailing list][joomla-dev-cms] for the CMS, the
  [Framework mailing list][joomla-dev-framework] for the Framework, or the
  [general mailing list][joomla-dev-general] for all other Joomla! projects.

[joomla-dev-cms]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-cms
[joomla-dev-framework]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-framework
[joomla-dev-general]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-general

## GitHub usage

All discussion regarding a Joomla! Feature and Specification RFC happens on the 
mailing lists. Issues are used for bug tracking, and any RFC might not get appropriate
attention on the Issue Tracker.

Please do not simply file an issue or PR and walk-away. The most likely outcome
is that it will not get seen or addressed in foreseeable time.

## Language and Translations

All Joomla! Feature / Specification RFCs are written in English.
Joomla! does not offer official translations into other languages
but other external entities are free to translate the RFCs in accordance
with the license.

## Voting

Voting is restricted to the Production Department Team Leaders and the Production 
Department Coordinator. The current list of Team Leaders is available on the [Volunteers Portal][]. Voting is conducted following the [Voting Protocol][].

## Attribution

The wording and structure for the documents in this repository are heavily inspired
by the [PHP FIG][]. In fact, the README, workflow bylaw, voting protocol, and the 
RFC document structure were created from copies of the FIG original.
