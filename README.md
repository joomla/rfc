# Joomla! Feature / Specification RFCs

A **Request for Comments** (RFC) is a commonly used publication format to discuss and document decisions.
This repository provides a central place for RFCs for new Features, Specifications and Processes for the Joomla!
projects.

To learn more about the importance of an RFC process, refer to the
article [How to Write RFCs for Open Source Projects](https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-write-rfcs-for-open-source-projects)
on DZone.
This RFC process follows the example of the PHP Framework Interoperation Group (PHP-FIG), which has worked successfully
for many years and still is.

An RFC can be in one of a couple of states, depending on maturity. These states are defined in the
[workflow document](bylaws/workflow.md).

## Proposing a Joomla! Feature or a Joomla! Specification

To propose a Feature / Specification:

- fork this repo, create a branch, checkout that branch, add the Feature / 
  Specification RFC in `proposed/`, push the branch to GitHub, and send a pull 
  request; or,
- create a ticket to start a discussion on GitHub; or,
- start a conversation on the [CMS mailing list][joomla-dev-cms] for the CMS, the
  [Framework mailing list][joomla-dev-framework] for the Framework, or the
  [general mailing list][joomla-dev-general] for all other Joomla! projects.

[joomla-dev-cms]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-cms
[joomla-dev-framework]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-framework
[joomla-dev-general]: https://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-general

## GitHub usage

All discussion regarding a Joomla! Feature and Specification RFC happens on the 
mailing lists. Issues are used for bug tracking, and any RFC might not get appropriate
attention on the Issue Tracker.

**Please do not simply file an issue or PR and walk-away. The most likely outcome
is that it will not get seen or addressed in foreseeable time.**
If you feel that no one cares about your proposal, please contact
the [Software Architecture & Strategy Team](https://volunteers.joomla.org/teams/software-architecture-strategy-working-group).
We want every idea to be taken seriously.

## Language and Translations

All Joomla! Feature / Specification RFCs are written in English.
Joomla! does not offer official translations into other languages
but other external entities are free to translate the RFCs in accordance
with the license.

## Voting

Voting is restricted to the Production Department Team Leaders and the Production 
Department Coordinator. The current list of Team Leaders is available on the [Volunteers Portal][]. Voting is conducted following the [Voting Protocol][].

## Attribution

The wording and structure for the documents in this repository are heavily inspired
by the [PHP FIG][]. In fact, the README, workflow bylaw, voting protocol, and the 
RFC document structure were created from copies of the FIG original.
