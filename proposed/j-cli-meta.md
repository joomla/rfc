The J-CLI is a standalone tool that will allow Joomla management via 
the command line. Many other projects have such a tool like 
WP-CLI by WordPress and Artisan by Laravel.

Having the J-CLI will make life easier for managing Joomla 
in an automated way. This helps businesses maintain their 
Joomla installations in a more efficient way. This will be a
