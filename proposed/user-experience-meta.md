# User Experience Meta Document
_Pre-Draft_

## 1. Summary

This specification provides common guidelines for people involved in Joomla User Experience (UX) decisions.

It introduces principles and metrics to enable discussion about and measurement of User Experience.

This guidance is intended to be generic and therefore not defining specific workflows or designs for the CMS or other
Joomla projects.

## 2. Why Bother?

When training users to work with their Joomla website, we often see new users struggling with the user interface. We get
feedback that some click paths are not intuitive or that there are too many options and options that are difficult to
understand.

Over the years there have been a number of teams, groups and individuals in the Joomla project who have tried to improve
the User Experience but failed to reach a long term agreement on the level of User Experience that Joomla wants to
implement. They often got lost in details about the size, position and colour of buttons because of a lack of
appropriate signposts.

A specification of

* the interaction principles to be considered and
* the metrics with which they can be quantified

helps stakeholders to focus on what is essential. This enables the  project to make a measurable and thus real progress
in terms of User Experience.

This specification supports [the mission and the key value "Usability"][Mission, Vision & Values] of the Joomla project.
