# Simplify Admin Interface Meta Document

## 1. Summary

Accessing the Backend with a more simple view

## 2. Why Bother?

Joomla's strength is to have many options, many systems donâ€™t have. But the backside of this is to irritate new users with the amount of settings.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 Goals

Setting up a basic and a advanced view of the backend to help onboarding new users.
Also experienced users will take advantage of that because a non overloaded backend will make daily work easier.

### 3.2 Non-Goals

## 4. Approaches

### 4.1 Permanently hide Options per User

The setting could be set in the user parameters.

### 4.2 Initially hide Options per Dialog

In many Linux dialogs, advanced options are hidden behind an `[Advanced]` button. This allows to reveal the options, whenever they are needed, without distracting when the dialog is shown initially. Once the `[Advanced]` button is pressed, all options are available.
