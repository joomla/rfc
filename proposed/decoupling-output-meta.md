# Decoupling Output Meta Document

## 1. Summary

_The separation of the visual preparation and presentation of the content from its management is what we call
decoupling of the output._

The aim of this specification is to decouple the output layer from the core of the CMS so that necessary changes to the
CMS code require as few changes as possible to the templates and their overrides.

## 2. Why Bother?

Every major version so far has stirred up resentment among users because not only programme code but also templates,
layouts and overrides had to be revised. If we succeed in reducing the points of contact between the CMS core and the
actual views to interfaces, not only will the adaptation effort for templates, layouts and overrides be considerably
less, it will even be possible to offer output layers with completely different frontend libraries than before.
