# Better UX, easier Onboarding, more consistent UI

## 1. Summary
 
This specification aims to define a more intuitive Backend for output.  

In the *basic mode* the backend will show only important options. 
It is going to add a switch for enable a advanced mode. 
The *advanced mode* shows all possible options.  


## 2. Why Bother?

A good start is essential!  

Most desicions for using or not using a CMS are made during the probation period, 
making the first tests with a CMS crucial for ensuring that useres get off to a flying start.  

This in turn is essential for promoting long-term user loyalty.  

A successful user onboarding process helps us increase the user engagement.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 Goals

This specification aims to provide a clear backend: 
A *view* that depends on the needs of the user.  

By default, a simple, clear backend is offered with few but important options.   
If a user has more experience, he can switch to advanced mode. 
Then he will be offered all possible options.

### 3.2 Non-Goals

This specification does not seek to make it possible, that a user can choose 
which options he like to see, because this will make everything more complex. 
We would like to simplify the backend!

## 4. Approaches

### 4.1 Dashboard

#### System

In the system dashboard I would suggest to display the red marked areas 
in the standard view and the others in the advanced view.
