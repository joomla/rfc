# Mobile App for Joomla Meta Document

## 1. Summary

Posting mobile and without hassle is state of the art. 

## 2. Why Bother?

Joomla is currently way behind this situation. Authors must have the possibility to post contents to their Joomla site such as easy as posting on Facebook, SnapChat, Instagram or other modern platforms.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 Goals

If an author wants to place new contents, it has to be easily done through a easy app.

- Sharing location
- upload images and videos and define their outputs (gallery, slideshow, single image, html5 video)
- Sharing Emotions / Aktivities
- upload quotes in a specified layout 
- Share an Event with a ics File
- Share a Link (with scraping Open Graph information)

Additional features could be:
- Set ACL in the post (public, registered)
- set the publishing state
- own ACL has to be respected 

What to think about:
- How to solve the login at activated 2FA authentication
- Security Issues 
- Accessibility 
- Share to other plattforms
- Touch / Face ID Login
- Editing existing posts
- How does Joomla receive and transform the data? Are there layouts taking care of the different post types
- Can the post be edited in the backend, can uploaded images be transformed into another “layout types” ?
- Multi-Platform
- Compress, Convert and Crop images and Videos
- Trigger Joomla Backup and Updates mobile ?
