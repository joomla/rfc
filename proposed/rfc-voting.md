# Voting Protocol

1. Only Class 1 and Class 2 members of Open Source Matters may initiate a call for
   votes on a measure.
2. All members of Open Source Matters (Class 1, 2 or 3) may vote on Entrance
   measures.
3. Only Class 1 and Class 2 members of Open Source Matters may vote on Acceptance
   measures.
4. The time limit on a vote is 14 days from the time of the call for votes for an
   Entrance vote and 7 days from the time of the call for votes for an Acceptance
   vote, or until all voting members have cast their vote, whichever comes first.
   Votes cast after the time limit are not valid.
5. Votes can be +1 (“in favor”), -1 (“against”), or 0 (“abstain”).
6. One-third or more of the voting members must vote within the time limit for the
   vote to be valid. This is the equivalent of establishing a quorum. For example:
      - If there are 20, 21, or 22 members, then 7 or more must vote within the
        time limit for the vote to be valid.
      - If there are 23, 24, or 25 members, then 8 or more must vote within the
        time limit for the vote to be valid.
7. The measure passes if a simple majority of the votes cast are “in favor”. The
   measure does not pass otherwise. For example:
      - If there are 10 or 11 votes cast, 6 or more must be "in favor".
      - If there are 12 or 13 votes cast, 7 or more must be "in favor".
8. Responsibility for vote tallying is shared between the member who starts a vote
   and the sponsors of the measure, both of whom should confirm the result.

_N.B.: “Abstain” votes are counted only for quorum, and are not counted when calculating majority._
