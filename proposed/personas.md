The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",

interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][].

## 1. User Groups

The name of a group consists of a noun that describes the relationship to the CMS. The name of a group MUST be unique.

* **Extension Developer** - A developer producing mass market extensions to make a living from it.
* **???** A developer producing bespoke applications on customer request based on the CMS.
* **Integrator** - A site builder (integrator) combining existing solutions to match a customer's request.
* **Designer** - A template designer creating the look and feel of a site.
* **Hobbyist** - A non-professional building a site for their own use.
* **Site Owner** - A site owner administering their own site.
* **Editor** - An editor creating and managing content.

These groups are further divided into different skill levels, which are used like adjectives.

* **newbie** - A new user with little or no experience.
* **novice** - A user with some experience.
* **intermediate** - A user with a good understanding of the CMS.
* **advanced** - A user with a deep understanding of the CMS.
* **expert** - A user with a deep understanding of the CMS and its internals.

Not all combinations of skill set and user group make sense. For example, a newbie extension developer does not exist.

A more detailed description of the user groups and the derived personas can be found below.

## 2. Personas

### 2.1. Extension Developer

An extension developer is a person who develops extensions for the Joomla CMS. The extensions are distributed through
the Joomla Extension Directory (JED) and are available for download and installation.

#### 2.1.1. Novice Extension Developer

This person has published one extension so far and wants to test how well the market works for them. If everything works
out, they want to offer further extensions to possibly make a living from it.
