# Append Form / Custom Fields for inputs - Meta Document

## 1. Summary

With this proposal it should be possible to append any form to an 
article. This could be a comment form, a buy button or a lead/contact 
form.

## 2. Why Bother?

Forms are a very important element for websites to generate leads and 
perform interaction. With extending custom fields to also have the 
possibility to have them as input fields on articles you could create a 
basic cart, comment, contact in core without a large overhead. 
The extensions for this task will never be obsolete because they offer 
way more functionality like database records, IP Blocking, moderation or 
whatever, but for a lot of basic usages this would be a great and 
extendable feature for Joomla. Extension developers also would have the 
possibility to sell specific custom fields for that usage.

* Benefit for the enduser: Earn money by easy generating leads with website
* Benefit for integrator / sitebuilder: Better maintainance
* Benefit for extension devs: New "Market" to sell custom field extensions

### 4.1 Extending Custom Fields

This feature could maybe be achieved by extending the functionality of 
custom fields and defining whether the field is shown as a input in the 
article or a input in the article creation. 

As it already works like that for contact forms it might be a possible 
task?
