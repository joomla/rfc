# Simple CCK Meta Document

## 1. Summary

A “Simple CCK” system for extending the data model of whatever type you are using and providing extended query and
display functionality (such as adding more query filters). Just a CMS extended with filter and ordering (by menu link or
module with switch, etc) and some nice view overrides.

For example, if you have a list of activities to do on weekends. With fields such as "date", "free or paid", "city". You
should be able to filter by activities in a specific city. And to be able to sort them by price or by date. In resume,
improve the Joomla Content as a Simple Content Construction Kit (but not a real or complex “Advanced CCK”, with real
content-type management, logical relation between them and for creating web apps (like Flexi, Seblod, Fabrik)

This specification aims to ...

## 2. Why Bother?

Actually, if you just want a CMS extended with filter and ordering, you need to use a third party CCK and stop using the
Joomla Core Articles, which prevents using the vast majority of Joomla's own utilities (like Joomla Core Tags, Joomla
Core Custom Fields, Joomla Core Categories, Joomla Multilanguage and Associations, Joomla Workflows, etc.) as well as
the vast majority of other third-party extensions.

Adding some order and filter option based on the custom fields will help creating Content website, keeping the Joomla!
spirit without bringing the CCK difficulties!

## 4. Approaches

Already in the days of the Idea Portal, the desire for a Content Construction Kit (CCK) was high on the wish list.
The feature request continues to pop up frequently.

In Joomla 3.1, a first attempt towards universal content was made with the Unified Content Model (UCM), but this was
never really pursued.
Most Joomla developers do not know how to use this concept properly - or simply ignore it.

Joomla 3.7 brought "custom fields" for articles and users.
This integration of a former version DP-Fields extension into the CMS.
As useful as this new functionality is, it is extremely limited because there is no way to filter or sort  by the value
of the custom fields.
